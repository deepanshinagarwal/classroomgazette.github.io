	<h3>Evolution of Man</h3>
<p>The earliest anthropoids, Parapithecus, Propliopithecus, etc., represented by the remains of jaws were first discovered in the Oligocene bed of Egypt.

The fossils of anthropoids of the Miocene period show considerable diversity with some possessing pre-human features. They may have evolved into the human line and others leading towards the great apes. Dryopithecus, an anthropoid fossil, is regarded to stand close to the point of divergence.

The process of evolution involves a series of changes that can cause those species to either adapt to the current environment or become extinct. Evolution is considered the result of changes that are being made in the genetic material of humans. It does not contribute to changing a single organism but contributes towards the changing of the entire group of organisms belonging to the same species.<br>

Man has been originated through several stages and these stages are explained below -<br> 

Dryopethicus - Dryopithecus is considered to be the earliest known ancestor of man. They were found in some parts of Africa, Asia, and Europe. It has been known that the evolution of man began from him. Dryopethicus was being followed by Australopithecus.<br>

Australopithecus - Australopithecus could walk upright and they were 1.2 meters tall. They have inhabited the mainland of Africa. They used to have human-like teeth and had large jaws. <br>

Homo habilis - Homo habilis used to have a height of around 5 feet and they could even make use of tools. It has been believed that they were able to speak. <br>

Homo erectus - It has been considered that Homo erectus was more evolved than beings. They used to have larger brains and they were also upright. They were the ones who invented the fire and were carnivorous. They also had a prominent speech.<br> 

Homo sapiens - Homo sapiens are known as modern men. Home sapiens had developed the power of thinking and using the tools. They were omnivorous and were able to produce art. Their brain size was reduced to 1300 cc.<br></p>
